# Tesla-API

This is a framework for iOS and macOS to easily communicate with the vehicle API offered by Tesla. The implementation is based on [Unofficial Tesla Model S API](https://docs.timdorr.apiary.io).

## Purpose

I want to be a part of the Tesla community and since I have a lot of experience with iOS engineering I decided that this was the best way to contribute.

## Requirements

Because of safety reasons this repo will never use 3rd party frameworks. I want people to use this codebase without being worried that someone will steal their credentials (which can lead to someone stealing your car). This was one of the reasons I decided to write this from scratch rather than using one of the existing implementations.

## Status

Please keep in mind that this project is on-going and I haven't had time to add or verify all functionality yet. If you have a Tesla and are willing to try out this implementation drop me a note on Twitter [@JagCesar](https://twitter.com/jagcesar) or open an Issue here on GitHub and I'll quickly throw together an example project. Open sourced of course so you know nothing weird is going on.
